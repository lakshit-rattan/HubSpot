### Amazing Social Networking Image Sharing Application using MERN Stack Logic
#### This project has been Bootstrapped with Create React App

The project represents an amazing social media image sharing platform which uses MERN stack behind it's working logic with :
1. React - Front-end
2. Mongo-DB - Back-end
3. Express & NodeJS - Back-end and API

## Features:
The 2 fundamental concepts of the app are:
1. Users
2. Places

Upon reaching the home Screen, the user first signs-up to create a user-ID. After creating an ID and then logging into it, the user then is able to create new places he wants, associated with his ID, using the "NEW PLACE" option. The logged in user can :
1. View the Place on Google Maps Platform
2. Edit the Place Details
3. Delete the Place

NOTE - The user can edit and delete only it's own places, while it can view it's own as well as places of other users.

When the user is on the website as a guest, then the home-screen would be flooded with the users signed up on the website and the places associated with each user. The project also supports image upload for both the user, as well as each place that the user creates. \
The project also supports both types of authentication features, i.e Sign-up and Login.
